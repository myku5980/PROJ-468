Accredited Programs   
Currently accredited programs are recognized under the Seoul Accord, a multi-lateral agreement among global agencies responsible for accreditation and recognition of tertiary-level computing education. Because of the universally essential nature of computer applications and the mobility of professionals across jurisdictional boundaries, there is a need to identify academic programs that adequately prepare graduates for entry into a computing profession based on generally recognized knowledge and abilities across countries and other jurisdictional boundaries. Toward this end, the Seoul Accord has established a mechanism for recognizing the equivalence of accredited educational qualifications in the development of computing professionals. The Seoul Accord provides for mutual recognition of graduates of accredited programs among the signatories of the accord.
